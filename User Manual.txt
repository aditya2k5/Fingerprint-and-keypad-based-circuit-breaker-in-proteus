User Manual: Arduino Fingerprint + Keypad Circuit Breaker Control System
This system securely controls a circuit breaker using dual authentication: fingerprint verification and a keypad PIN code. It is designed to enhance electrical safety by ensuring only authorized personnel can switch the circuit breaker ON or OFF.

Features

Dual authentication using fingerprint sensor and keypad PIN code.

Secure PIN storage in EEPROM with option to reset via admin fingerprint.

LCD displays user prompts, status, and feedback.

Visual (LED) and audible (buzzer) feedback for access granted or denied.

Relay output controls the circuit breaker (or contactor).

Admin mode for resetting/updating PIN securely.


How to Use

Power On
System initializes, LCD displays "System Ready".

Default PIN is set to "1234" if EEPROM is empty.

Turning ON the Circuit Breaker
LCD prompts "Place Finger...".

Place finger on sensor.

If fingerprint matches authorized prints, LCD shows "Fingerprint OK".

Enter 4-digit PIN on keypad when prompted.

Correct PIN activates relay to switch breaker ON.

LCD shows "Turned ON", buzzer beeps once, LED flashes twice.

If fingerprint or PIN invalid, LCD shows "Access Denied", buzzer sounds multiple beeps.



Turning OFF the Circuit Breaker

When breaker is ON, LCD shows "Enter PIN to OFF".

Enter your PIN to deactivate relay and switch breaker OFF.

Success feedback: LCD shows "Turned OFF", buzzer and LED feedback.

Failure feedback: "Access Denied" with buzzer alert.



Reset or Change PIN (Admin Mode)

During PIN entry, press #.

LCD displays "Reset PIN Mode" then "Admin Finger...".

Scan admin fingerprint.

If authorized, LCD prompts to "Enter New PIN:".

Enter new 4-digit PIN.

LCD confirms "PIN Updated!".
