# Project Description
This project implements a secure door lock system using an ATmega328P microcontroller, which integrates both fingerprint authentication and keypad password entry. The system enhances security for restricted access areas by combining biometric and PIN-based entry, and provides feedback via an LCD screen, LED indicator, and buzzer.
