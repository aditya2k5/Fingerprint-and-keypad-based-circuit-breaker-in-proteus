# Fingerprint-and-keypad-based-circuit-breaker-in-proteus
# Project Description
This project implements a secure door lock system using an ATmega328P microcontroller, which integrates both fingerprint authentication and keypad password entry. The system enhances security for restricted access areas by combining biometric and PIN-based entry, and provides feedback via an LCD screen, LED indicator, and buzzer.
# Features
Fingerprint Authentication: Uses a standard fingerprint sensor to verify user identity.

Password Input: 4x4 Matrix Keypad enables PIN entry as a secondary authentication method.

LCD Display: Presents user prompts, authentication status, and system feedback (16x2 LCD).

Security Feedback: Buzzer and LED indicate success or failure of authentication attempts.

Relay Control: System activates a relay to unlock the door when correct credentials are presented.

User-Friendly Interface: Real-time instructions and system state display.
